### 🚀 How It Works: The "AI" Logic

The Omni-Oracle isn't magic—it's smart, tiered logic designed to find value where others miss it. When you "Synthesize Prophecy" in Oracle Mode, it follows this sequence:

1.  **Value in the Underdog:** It first checks if the underdog's handicap odds present a high-value opportunity (odds between 1.7 - 2.5). This is often the most profitable stream.
2.  **High-Scoring Game:** If no handicap value is found, it analyzes the "Total" market for a likely "Over" bet in a sweet spot of probability (odds between 1.6 - 2.0).
3.  **The Probable Favorite:** If neither of the above value streams is detected, it defaults to the most direct reality: predicting the favorite to win.

This ensures you're not just betting on low odds, but on the *smartest* bet available.
